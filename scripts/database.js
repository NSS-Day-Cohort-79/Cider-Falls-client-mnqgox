//const database = will have the Areas array, guests array, and services array
const database = [
    Area = {
        
    }
]

//Then we will make three functions that will create a structure clone of the three separate arrays 

//getArea() = this will create a structureClone of the Area array and export it to parkAreas.js

//getGuest() = this will create a structureClone of the guest array and export it to guest.js

//getServices() = this will create a structureClone of the services array and export it to services.js
